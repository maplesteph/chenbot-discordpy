# chenbot
chenbot, now for discord (successor to her irc version)

as was with her irc version, chenbot's purpose is to be a modular discord bot. not every server will want to take advantage of every service she offers, so chen can freely pick and choose which modules to keep active for which servers and she can tailor module configurations specific to that server's needs. ultimately, chen doesn't do anything unique or productive in particular - she is just a shitposting bot. the other downside is that every server gets an instance of every module, so runtime is heavy.
